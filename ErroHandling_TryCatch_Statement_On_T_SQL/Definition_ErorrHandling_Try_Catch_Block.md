\## Introduction

Error handling in T-SQL is a crucial aspect of writing robust SQL code. It allows you to gracefully handle unexpected events and errors that occur during the execution of SQL scripts.



\# Why is Error Handling Important?

Prevents Data Corruption: Proper error handling can prevent partial updates and maintain data integrity.

User-Friendly Feedback: It can provide meaningful information to the user or calling application about what went wrong.

Flow Control: It allows the code to continue running or to stop based on the severity of the error.

\# TRY...CATCH in T-SQL

The primary mechanism for error handling in T-SQL is the TRY...CATCH construct.



TRY Block: You place the T-SQL code that might cause an error inside a TRY block. If an error occurs, execution is passed to the associated CATCH block.

CATCH Block: The CATCH block contains code that runs if an error occurs in the TRY block. It can log the error, roll back transactions, and take other appropriate actions.

\# Error Functions

Within the CATCH block, you can use functions to get detailed error information:



ERROR\_NUMBER(): Returns the error number.

ERROR\_SEVERITY(): Returns the severity.

ERROR\_STATE(): Returns the error state number.

ERROR\_PROCEDURE(): Returns the name of the stored procedure or trigger where the error occurred.

ERROR\_LINE(): Returns the line number where the error occurred.

ERROR\_MESSAGE(): Returns the complete text of the error message.

#Best Practices
Use TRY...CATCH for all your transactions: Protect your data integrity by wrapping transactions in a TRY...CATCH block.
Log Errors: Always log errors for later analysis, which can help in understanding what went wrong.
Provide User Feedback: Where appropriate, pass back information to the user, but avoid revealing sensitive information about the database structure or system.

## Understanding Error Functions in T-SQL
# Introduction
In T-SQL (Transact-SQL used in Microsoft SQL Server), error handling is an essential aspect of writing robust and reliable database applications. SQL Server provides several functions that can be used within a CATCH block of a TRY...CATCH construct to retrieve detailed information about errors. Understanding these functions is crucial for diagnosing and responding to errors effectively.

# Error Functions Overview
# ERROR_NUMBER()
Purpose: Returns the error number of the error that caused the CATCH block to be executed.
Usage: Useful for identifying the specific error that occurred.
# ERROR_SEVERITY()
Purpose: Returns the severity level of the error.
Usage: Helps in understanding the nature and seriousness of the error. Severity levels range from 0 to 25.
# ERROR_STATE()
Purpose: Returns the state number of the error.
Usage: Useful for providing additional information about the error or to distinguish between errors with the same number.
# ERROR_PROCEDURE()
Purpose: Returns the name of the stored procedure or trigger in which the error occurred.
Usage: Essential for identifying the source of the error in complex systems with multiple procedures and triggers.
# ERROR_LINE()
Purpose: Returns the line number where the error occurred.
Usage: Helps in pinpointing the exact location in the code where the error was raised, facilitating quicker debugging.
# ERROR_MESSAGE()
Purpose: Provides the complete text of the error message.
Usage: Offers a detailed description of the error, which is valuable for understanding what went wrong.
